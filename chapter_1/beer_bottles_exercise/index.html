  Is better to put links to scripts in the body of the page (and not the head)

  Why?

  JavaScript loads the head section first and then the body
  So if I kept my script in the head, and it took a long time to load, the user
  might have to wait a while to see something on the page.
  If I have the script link in the page body,
  the experience for the user will be better.

  See explanation on page 32

    <script src="code.js"></script>
</body>
