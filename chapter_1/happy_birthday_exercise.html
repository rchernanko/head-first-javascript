document.write("Happy Birthday dear " + name + ",<br>");

document.write("Happy Birthday to you.<br>");


var i = 0;



i = i + 1;


document.write("Happy Birthday to you.<br>");

while (i < 2) {



var name = "Joe";


}




SHOULD END UP SAYING:

happy birthday to you
happy birthday to you
happy birthday dear Joe
happy birthday to you
